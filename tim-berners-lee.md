Tim Berners Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. He was a British computer scientist and was the inventor of the World Wide Web. Berners-lee entered CERN in 1980, and during that time Berners-lee developed a program he called Enquire that stored information in files with links both within and among separate files which was called hypertext. In 1989 Berners-lee made a proposal to create a global hypertext document system that used the internet. His goal was to give researchers the ability to share results, methods, and practices without exchanging emails constantly, and instead would post the information online for others to see. In 1994 in the US he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer lab and later in 2000 became the author of Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web. link (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee)
