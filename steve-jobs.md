Steve Jobs in his early years contacted the co-founder and president Hewlett-Packard, William Hewlett, for parts for a project in high school. This action made Hewlett so impressed that he offered Jobs a summer internship working at Hewlett-Plackard which was the stepping stone needed to create Apple. Jobs convinced a friend he made at the internship known as Wozniak who he convinced to go into business and together they created the Apple company in 1975. The Apple 1 computer was created and released shortly after the company was created and was a very successful computer which made the business duo enough money to expand. Later they made the Apple 2 in 1977, 2 years after the invention of the Apple 1. In the first year Apple made $3 million dollars however with the release of the Apple 2 they made $200 million dollars. In 1984 when Apple was competing with IBM they made the AppleMacintosh which was the first graphical user interface which a mouse could control. link(https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/who-was-steve-jobs-see-the-apple-founders-career-and-more/197538)
