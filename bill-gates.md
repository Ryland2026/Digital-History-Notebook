William Henry Gates was born on October 28, 1955 and in 1968 will find his way into the world of computers. Gates alongside some of his classmates were interested in the new technology at Lakeside school like  the General electric computer. Gates and his classmates would spend more time on the device than their classes which would make their programming skills develop.  Gates' business started with Traf-O-Data with his Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. At Harvard Gates made a new programming language called the MITS Altair which led to his business of Microsoft with Paul Allen. Gates and Allen made a BASIC interpreter for the Altair without writing a single line of code. Microsoft later partnered with IBM (largest market at the time) was the main reason that made Microsoft the center of software development. The devices they sold were called QDOS (quick and dirty operating systems) but later renamed MS-DOS (microsoft disk operating system) and were highly successful in the partnership with IBM. In 2000 Gates stepped down from CEO and remained as chairman and chief software architect. Link (https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/bill-gates-the-man-who-put-a-computer-in-every-home)
